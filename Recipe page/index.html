            <h1 id="work"> WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>By parboiling the rice, this Chicken Biryani 
                    can be steamed instead of boiled. 
                    This renders the chicken tender and juicy.</li>
                <li>Marinating the chicken and then browning it ensures it is seasoned to the core
                     while creating new layers of flavor thanks to Maillard browning.</li>
                <li>Properly caramelizing the fried onions adds loads of umami, 
                    and it also lends a subtle sweetness that's the perfect contrast to the savory and spicy chicken.

            <h1 id="for">INGREDIENTS FOR CHICKEN BIRYANI</h1>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chicken</strong>-For the most flavor, 
                    I recommend using a bone-in skin-on piece of chicken such as thighs
                     or drumsticks. Breast meat will work in a pinch, but it won't be as flavorful, 
                    and it will get dry due to the longer cooking time of this dish. </li>
                <li><strong>Aromatics</strong>The chicken is marinated with ginger
                     garlic paste along with herbs and spices. 
                    As the chicken steams, it releases all these flavors into the rice. </li>
                <li><strong>Herbs</strong> I like to use fresh herbs like cilantro 
                    (a.k.a. coriander leaves), and fresh mint leaves in my marinade for the chicken. These also make for a nice garnish to sprinkle on top of the Chicken Biryani, 
                    so be sure to chop up a little extra. </li>
                <li><strong>Spices</strong>-I use ground spices like garam ma
                    sala and ground cinnamon for the chicken marinade. If you can
                     find it, Biryani masala works well too. For the rice, I include whole spices such as green cardamom, cumin, and bay leaves. I also sometimes like to add some cloves or star anise here. The yellow color in the rice comes from saffron, but if you can't find it
                    , turmeric makes a suitable substitute. </li>
                <li><strong>Onions </strong>-Along with the chicken and rice, 
                    the third 
                    component of Biryani is fried onions, and I
                     like to have a lot of them. </li>
                <li><strong>Ghee</strong>- Ghee is butter with the milk prote
                    ins and water removed, making it clear. This is why it's also called "clarified butter." It gives you the flavor of butter withou
                     worrying about the milk solids burning. </li>
                <li><strong>Chili Peppers</strong>-I usually use fresh green chilies in my marinade for the chicken to add some heat to this dish,
                     but red chili powder will work as well. </li>
                <li><strong>Rice</strong>-Biryani should always be made with long-grain rice.
                     I recommend using basmati. </li>
            </ul>
