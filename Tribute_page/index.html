          Field Marshal Sam Hormusji Framji Jamshedji Manekshaw, popularly known
          as Sam Bahadur, stands as an iconic figure in the annals of Indian
          military history. Born on April 3, 1914, in Amritsar, his journey
          unfolded against the backdrop of a nation undergoing significant
          transformations. Sam Manekshaw's early years were characterized by an
          upbringing that reflected the rich cultural tapestry of India. His
          Parsi heritage and exposure to a diverse society laid the foundation
          for a leader who would embrace diversity in the military, fostering
          unity among troops from various backgrounds. Manekshaw's military
          career began in 1932 when he joined the first batch of the Indian
          Military Academy in Dehradun. Little did the nation know that this
          young officer would go on to become one of its greatest military
          minds. His early experiences in the army were marked by postings in
          different theaters, including the Middle East during World War II. The
          turning point in Manekshaw's career came during the 1971 Indo-Pak war,
          which led to the liberation of Bangladesh. As the Chief of the Army
          Staff, he exhibited strategic brilliance, military prowess, and
          exceptional leadership. His planning and execution of the operations
          played a pivotal role in the decisive victory of the Indian Armed
          Forces. One of the defining moments of his career occurred during the
          1971 war when he addressed the troops on the Western Front. Known for
          his wit and candor, he boosted the morale of the soldiers with his
          famous quote, "You can die for your country but you cannot live for
          your country." This exemplified his ability to connect with the troops
          at a human level, transcending the usual hierarchical barriers. In
          recognition of his exemplary service, leadership, and outstanding
          contributions, Sam Manekshaw was appointed as the eighth Chief of the
          Army Staff and later became the first Indian Army officer to be
          promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. His military acumen and
          strategic vision were not just limited to the battlefield but extended
          to reshaping the ethos of the Indian Army. Beyond his military
          achievements, Sam Manekshaw was revered for his integrity and
          straightforwardness. He was a man of principles, known for speaking
          his mind even if it meant standing against prevailing sentiments. His
          commitment to the welfare of soldiers, coupled with an unwavering
          focus on the nation's security, set a benchmark for leadership in the
          armed forces. The legacy of Sam Manekshaw extends beyond his
          retirement in 1973. His influence on subsequent generations of
          military leaders is evident in the principles of professionalism,
          discipline, and commitment that he instilled in the armed forces. The
          Sam Manekshaw Memorial Lecture, instituted in his honor, serves as a
          platform for contemporary military leaders to reflect on his teachings
          and apply them in the evolving geopolitical landscape. Field Marshal
          Sam Manekshaw's life and career embody the essence of a dedicated
          soldier, a visionary strategist, and a charismatic leader. His
          indomitable spirit, combined with a rare blend of humility and
          courage, leaves an enduring imprint on the collective memory of a
          grateful nation. As India pays tribute to this legendary military
          commander, it also cherishes the values he upheld, ensuring that the
          legacy of Sam Bahadur continues to inspire generations to come.
